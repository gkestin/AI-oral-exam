- Disrespectful or inappropriate behavior
- Complete inability to explain own work
- Evidence of no preparation

## Consistency Checks for Grading Models

### When Reviewing Grades
1. Check for internal consistency within categories
2. Verify that specific examples support scores
3. Ensure feedback aligns with numerical scores
4. Compare similar performance levels across sessions
5. Flag any scores that deviate >15% from peer models

### Required Evidence
- Direct quotes from student responses
- Specific examples of strength/weakness
- Clear rationale for each category score
- Identification of key moments in examination
- Constructive feedback for improvement

## Grade Calculation Formula

```
Final Score = (Conceptual × 0.30) + (Critical × 0.25) + (Communication × 0.20) + (Application × 0.25) + Modifiers

Letter Grade:
A  (93-100): Exceptional performance
A- (90-92):  Nearly exceptional
B+ (87-89):  Very good performance
B  (83-86):  Good performance
B- (80-82):  Above average
C+ (77-79):  Slightly above average
C  (73-76):  Average performance
C- (70-72):  Below average
D  (60-69):  Poor but passing
F  (0-59):   Failing
```

## Guidelines for Deliberation Rounds

### Round 1 (Independent Assessment)
- Each model grades independently
- No access to other models' scores
- Focus on evidence-based assessment

### Round 2 (Deliberation - if needed)
- Triggered when model agreement < 80%
- Models can see each other's scores and rationale
- Must justify any score changes
- Focus on reaching consensus through evidence

### Final Aggregation
- Weighted average of all model scores
- Higher weight for models with more consistent grading history
- Document any persistent disagreements
- Flag for human review if agreement < 70%

## Special Circumstances

### Technical Difficulties
- If audio quality impacts assessment: Note and adjust expectations
- If connection issues occur: Pro-rate based on completed portions
- If student has documented disabilities: Apply appropriate accommodations

### Non-Native Speakers
- Focus on content over language proficiency
- Allow for minor grammatical issues
- Assess understanding, not accent or pronunciation
- Provide extra time if needed

### Anxiety or Stress
- Note signs of test anxiety
- Adjust pacing and tone accordingly
- Weight content knowledge more heavily
- Provide positive reinforcement

Remember: The goal is fair, accurate assessment that helps students learn and grow.
